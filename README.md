# Reliance Stock Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Reliance Industries’ historical stock performance to uncover patterns, assess market risks, and forecast short-term movements. By applying machine learning and statistical techniques, the aim is not just to model stock price behavior, but to generate insights that support **investment decisions, risk management, and portfolio optimization**.

## Problem Statement
Stock price movements directly affect investment returns, hedging strategies, and capital allocation. Reliance Industries, being exposed to global energy prices, regulatory policies, and company-specific developments, presents both opportunities and risks for investors.  

This project seeks to answer:  
- How do trends, seasonality, and market noise shape Reliance’s stock price movements?  
- Which features provide the strongest predictive signals for short-term trading or risk assessment?  
- Can machine learning models deliver actionable forecasts that enhance investment strategies?

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Historical stock prices and trading indicators were analyzed as inputs to simulate real-world decision contexts.  
   - Future versions could integrate macroeconomic variables (e.g., crude oil prices, inflation) relevant to Reliance’s core business.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Seasonality, trends, and noise were decomposed to distinguish structural drivers from random fluctuations—important for risk and return planning.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Predictive models were developed to test short-term forecasting performance, benchmarking potential tools for investors.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning and expanded feature sets were identified as areas for improvement.  

4. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Volatility analysis, especially during the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis, demonstrates how external shocks affect Reliance’s stock.  
   - Lessons from these events can inform risk management strategies for portfolios holding Reliance.

## Findings
- **Volatility and Risk**  
  - Historical crises revealed extreme price swings, underscoring the importance of robust risk controls.  

- **Feature Importance**  
  - Price ranges and trading volume emerged as strong predictors.  
  - Incorporating macroeconomic and sectoral signals could further improve forecast accuracy.  

- **Model Performance**  
  - The baseline model shows potential for short-term forecasting, but requires refinement to deliver **actionable insights** for portfolio managers and traders.

## Future Directions
- Incorporate additional features such as macroeconomic and sectoral indicators.  
- Experiment with advanced time-series models (e.g., LSTMs) for higher predictive accuracy.  
- Develop dashboards or decision-support tools to make outputs more usable for investment professionals.
