# Reliance Stock Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the stock market trends of Reliance Industries, analyzing historical data to uncover patterns, assess risks, and predict future movements. By utilizing advanced machine learning models and statistical techniques, the project aims to enhance understanding of stock behavior and provide actionable insights for investors.

## Problem Statement
Stock markets are inherently volatile and influenced by numerous factors such as global economic events, market trends, and company-specific developments. Understanding and predicting these trends can help investors make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and maximize returns. This project addresses the following questions:

- How do trends, seasonality, and noise impact Reliance's stock price over time?
- What features are most predictive of stock price movements?
- Can machine learning models provide accurate short-term forecasts?

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Historical stock prices were analyzed with features such as opening prices, high/low prices, and adjusted closing prices.
   - Additional economic indicators (e.g., recession, inflation) were suggested for future iterations.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Seasonality, trends, and noise decomposition were performed to gain deeper insights.

3. **Model Training:**
   - A machine learning model was built to predict stock prices using selected features.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and additional feature inclusion were identified as potential improvement areas.

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Volatility analysis highlighted significant market fluctuations, especially during the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis.

## Findings
- **Volatility and Risk:**
  - The 2008-2009 period showed extreme volatility due to the Global Financial Crisis.
  - Understanding such historical events is crucial for risk mitigation.

- **Feature Importance:**
  - Initial analysis highlighted the importance of features such as high/low prices and trading volume.
  - Incorporating macroeconomic factors could further improve model accuracy.

- **Model Performance:**
  - The initial model provides a baseline but requires enhancements through hyperparameter tuning and expanded feature sets.

## Future Directions
- Incorporate additional features such as macroeconomic indicators.
- Explore advanced models (e.g., LSTMs or other time-series models).
- Conduct extensive hyperparameter optimization to improve predictive performance.
